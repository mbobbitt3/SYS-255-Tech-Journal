#LAB 01 Environment Setup
In this lab we cofnigured the firewall for LAN and WANs assigning each interface their own identifier em0 and em1 as well as changing some network configuration options on a host machine to utilize the firewall we had set up on another VM. We used some basic networking commands as well like tracert, ipconfig, whoami, etc. to verify that we had configured our firewall correctly.
